### Burn Down for iteration-2 (see chapter 4):
* 4 weeks left, 10 days of estimated amount of work left
* 3 weeks left, 10 days of estimated amount of work left
* 2 weeks left, 6 days of estimated amount of work left
* 1 week left, 6 days of estimated amount of work left
* 0 week/s left, 0 days of estimated amount of work left

Actual Velocity: 0.25 (see below)

#### How to calculate actual velocity:
* Actual Velocity = total days of work accomplished / (number of actual working days * number of developers)

#### Calculation of actual velocity:
* Total days of work accomplished = 10 days
* Number of actual working days = 20 days
* Number of developers = 2


* Actual Velocity = 10 / (20 * 2) = 10 / 40 = 0.25
