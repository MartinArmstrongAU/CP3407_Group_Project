# Implementation

Due to a large number of unfortunate events, the production of the website and it's documentation have been severly limited from what it was initially planned as.

## Iteration 1:

- Team Starting Status: 4 active members
- Then: 2 active members (1 quit due to floods, 1 ghosted the team multiple times and gave an innitial reason of floods)
- Then: 1 active member (other was hospitalised for multiple weeks and had to take mind altering medicine afterwards)

### Needed:

In Iteration 1, it was planned for the team to complete a total of 9 user stories (11, 01, 21, 23, 12, 05, 24 and 22). It was calculated that each team member would do two to three stories each. Due to the lack of activity from most of the team, only three user stories were completed by Joshua Finch "JF" (11, 01, 21). Further effort by JF was not attempted due to other unrelated tasks (assignments) and personal problems that effected motivation (death and funeral of a grandparent).

### On Time:

Aside from the user stories that went unfinshed, the ones assigned to JF were all completed on time for an extended due date of Iteration 1.

### On Budget:

The budget for this Iteration (and the project as a whole) was set at $0.00. This limitation was kept in Iteration 1 through the use of free tools and the developers not getting payed (due to it being a university assignment).

### Client Feedback

Unhappy about the lack of agreed upon progress. But understanding of the difficulties facing the team. Due to the low chance that the project will catch up to the prior expected pace under the current team, no more Iterations will be authorised beyond what is already planned (Iteration 2). The project will likely be either used as a test and discontinued or used as a bumping-off point for a later team.

## Iteration 2: 

- Team Starting Status: 2 active members (1 member with little time due to catching up on multiple subjects)
- Velocity was significantly decreased due to the low throughput in Iteration 1. With multiple assignments due and a lot of catching up to do for specific team members it was not expected to be greatly surpassed.

### Needed:

For Iteration 2 it was planned for the team to finish two of the highest priority user stories (23, 5) that fit in the revised velocity. Those being the ability for members to search for cleaners from a database and for them to book a session from said cleaners. Due to the nature of the free version of Wix Studio and the expected low amounts of attention able to be directed towards this project the team members could only garuntee that these user storiers would be completed as they were larger in scope than the stories completed in Iteration 1. Any further available time would be spend on attempting to complete the remaining user stories that would have been completed in Iteration 1.

### On Time:

Due to further complications due to other critical tasks going over their alloted time budget. While both specified user stories were completed, they required a significant  extensions of the due date. Still, the project is on track to be handed in before the final deadline: quote "before the exam" unquote. 

### On Budget:

Same as Iteration 1, the budget for this Iteration (and the project as a whole) was set at $0.00. This limitation was kept in Iteration 1 through the use of free tools and the developers not getting payed (due to it being a university assignment).

### Client Feedback

The further delays are definitely not helping but the client is satisfied that the agreed upon revisions to the expected user stories have been completed and that the teams velocity has not lowered yet again.

## UI, Database and Deployment Choice

To properly display the UI and the database, varius images from the website have been taken.

### UI
Showing: the Home Page; Team Members; Specific Cleaner's Details (bottem of page); Member's Profile; Searching Cleaners and Specific Cleaner's Details (Top of Page)

### Deployment Choice
Due to the use of Wix Studio, it handles all hosting and deployment for us.
