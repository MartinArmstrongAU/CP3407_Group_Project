## Wix Studio
To create the website for this assignment our team chose to use the Wix Studio IDE instead of competitors such as the regular Wix Editor, Squarespace and Weebly due to the fact that it offered the ability to create websites
without the need to code and the fact that it had a widely recommended free version that allowed multiple people to work on the same project/website without requiring extensive setup or an increase in cost.

Unfortunately, what was not advertised about Wix Studio is that while it allows developers to create using the official Components nad Features of the IDE. It does not allow customisation or even full functionality for certain
pieces that are critical to the use of a website. For our team specifically, it caused:

- The profile pages that are created during the sign-up of new members to not be able to be customised by members (or developers) or have forms added that would allow for further functionality. This caused work in iteration one
to be effectively wasted effort without spending money to unlock those features.

- The members database from the innitial signup was unable to be modified to also be used for other functions that were critical to the website's functions

- The booking component was able to be implemented and allowed backend use (modifying lists of services) and frontend viewing of said services for users but didn't allow for them to be used for online booking.

Due to time, fiscal and manpower constraints these problems were not able to be surmounted either through switching to a different IDE, paying the fee or through coding and testing said code ourselves.
