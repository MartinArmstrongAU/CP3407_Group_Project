# Actual Iteration-1 Board [duration: 5 weeks, start date: 17/02/2025, end date: 23/03/2025]

## NOTES (for Dmitry):
* Floods at the beginning of the trimester forced one of our team members (Alex Williams) to drop out of the subject.
* Another team member (Cobey Smith) has not communicated at all with the team since week 2 (last message on 6/2/2025).
* Another team member (Martin Armstrong) was hospitalized at the start of Week 5 (24/02/2025) with first symptoms
appearing in the middle of week 4 (20/02/2025) which lasted for multiple weeks until the start of week 7 (17/03/2025)
during which time they were taking several different medications that prevented clear thoughts (resulting in a lack of 
contributions and thus could not participate in iteration-1).
* Another team member (Joshua Finch), had to attend their grandfather's funeral at about the same time that Martin fell
ill (they will provide proof if requested/required) and thus didn't get much done for multiple weeks in a row, which is
also the reason for their lack of weekly practical submissions (there simply wasn't anything to report progress-wise).
* This is a reminder that you gave us a week-long extension for Iteration-1, also extending the end date for Iteration-2.  

## Checklist: 
1. - [x] GitHub entry timestamps - DONE
2. - [x] User stories are correct: see p39 - DONE

* Assumed Velocity: 1.0 (explained in [initial iteration plan](./initial_iteration_plan))
* Number of developers: 2 (but initially expected and planned to be 3)
* Total estimated amount of work: 40 working days

## User stories or tasks (see chapter 4):
1. [User Story 11: Create Cleaner Profile (as an Individual Cleaner)](./user_stories/user_story_11.md), (priority 10), (3 days)
   * Task 1: Implement a basic and user-specific, customisable profile page gated behind a user logging in.
   * Task 2: (Links to later user stories) Add specific sections that are only visible for other users if they are registered as specific member types.


2. [User Story 01: Create Company Profile (as a Cleaning Business)](./user_stories/user_story_01.md), (priority 20), (4 days)
   * Task 1: Defunct/Folded into User Story 11 - the basic Wix login module doesn't allow multiple types of user accounts, only different permissions on page viewing. Changing that either needs payment or custom code that
     means throwing out ther currently uneditable Wix provided module. Essentially, Buisiness accounts will simply be mechanically the same as regular cleaner accounts, just with different content (links to affiliated cleaners).


3. [User Story 21: Create an Account (as a Customer)](./user_stories/user_story_21.md), (priority 20), (3 days)
   * Task 1: Implement login and sign up features and required functionality using Wix Studio's module.
   * Task 2: Create multiple member types (Staff, Buisiness, Cleaner, User) for users to be sorted into by staff members.
   * Task 3: Create initial accounts to test features + provide examples for client.

### Burn Down for iteration-1 (see chapter 4):
Update this at least once per week:
* 5 weeks left, 40 days of estimated amount of work left (added a 5th week because we got an extension)
* 4 weeks left, 40 days of estimated amount of work left
* 3 weeks left, 40 days of estimated amount of work left
* 2 weeks left, 40 days of estimated amount of work left
* 1 week left, 40 days of estimated amount of work left
* 0 week/s left, 30 days of estimated amount of work left

Actual Velocity: 0.25 (see below)

#### How to calculate actual velocity:
E1 = Estimated user-story days (per developer) (after the poker game). For example 70
A1 = actual required (per developer) days. For example 100 working days
V1 = velocity in iteration-1
E1 / v1 = A1, or A1 * v1 = E1, or E1 / A1 = V1

From iteration-1 we finished E2 (ideal estimated days). Assuming we spent A1 working days (per developer) we will get
A1 = E1 / V1 = E2 / V2, then V2 = E2/E1 * V1,
for example, E2 = 60, then V2 = (60/70) * 0.7 = 0.6

#### Calculation of actual velocity:
* E1 = Estimated user-story days (per developer) (after the poker game) = 40 days
* A1 = Actual required days (per developer) = 40 working days
* V1 = Initial assumed first pass velocity in iteration-1 (explanation in [initial iteration plan](./initial_iteration_plan)) = 1.0


* E2 = 10 days
* V2 = E2 / E1 * V1 = 10 / 40 * 1 = 0.25
* Actual Velocity = 0.25
