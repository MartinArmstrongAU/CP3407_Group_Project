# Actual iteration-1 board, (see chapters 3 and 4), add your start and end dates 

Note for Dmitry. 
- Floods at the begining of the trimester forced one of the team members to drop out of the subject.
- A second team member has ghosted the remaining members since Week 2-3.
- A third team member (Martin Armstrong) got hospitalized around Week 4-5 for multiple weeks + had medication that prevented clear thoughts and thus could not participate in the iteration.
- At about the same time as Martin fell ill I, (Joshua Finch) had to attend my grandfather's funeral (will provide proof if requested/required) and thus didn't get much done for multiple weeks in a row, that being the reason for my lack of weekly prac submissions (there simply wasn't anything to report progress-wise) but completed quizs.
A reminder that you gave me and Martin a week's extension for Iteration 1 that also pushed back the due date for Iteration 2.

- User Story 21:
  * Task 1: Implement login and sign up features and required functionality using Wix Studio's module.
  * Task 2: Create multiple member types (Staff, Buisiness, Cleaner, User) for users to be sorted into by staff members
  * Task 3. Create initial accounts to test features + provide examples for client.
- User Story 11: 
  * Task 1: Implement a basic and user-specific, customisable profile page gated behind a user logging in.
  * Task 2: (Links to later user stories) Add specific sections that are only visible for other users if they are registered as specific member types.
User Story 01:
  * Task 1: Defunct/Folded into User Story 11 - the basic Wix login module doesn't allow multiple types of user accounts, only different permissions on page viewing. Changing that either needs payment or custom code that
    means throwing out ther currently uneditable Wix provided module. Essentially, Buisiness accounts will simply be mechanically the same as regular cleaner accounts, just with different content (links to affiliated 
    cleaners).
