# Actual iteration-1 board, (see chapters 3 and 4), add your start and end dates 

Note for Dmitry. 
- Floods at the begining of the trimester forced one of the team members to drop out of the subject.
- A second team member has ghosted the remaining members since Week 2-3.
- A third team member (Martin Armstrong) got hospitalized around Week 4-5 for multiple weeks + had medication that prevented clear thoughts and thus could not participate in the iteration.
- At about the same time as Martin fell ill I, (Joshua Finch) had to attend my grandfather's funeral (will provide proof if requested/required) and thus didn't get much done for multiple weeks in a row, that being the reason for my lack of weekly prac submissions (there simply wasn't anything to report progress-wise) but completed quizs.
A reminder that you gave me and Martin a week's extension for Iteration 1 that also pushed back the due date for Iteration 2.
