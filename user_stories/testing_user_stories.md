# Page is for showing proof of tests for each completed user story 

## Iteration 1:

- User Story 21: Create Cleaner Profile - as an Individual Cleaner

Implemented solution does not use developer written code, but instead uses a standard, free Wix module. Proof is in the
form of two screenshots: the first being the view that a new cleaner would see when newly signed in for the first time,
while the second is of an empty (un-customised) cleaner's profile.

Implemented solution does not use developer written code, but instead uses a standard, free Wix module. Proof is in the
form of two screenshots: the first being the view that a new user would see attempting to sign in, while the second is 
of a user signed in.

- User Story 1: Create Company Profile - as a Cleaning Business

Implemented solution does not use developer written code, but instead uses a standard, free Wix module. Proof is in the
form of two screenshots: the first being the view that a new business would see when newly signed in for the first time,
while the second is of an empty (un-customised) business' profile.

## Iteration 2:

- User Story 23: View Cleaner Profiles - as a Customer

Initial method used to make Profiles in Iterations 1 (User stories 1 and 21) were found to be un-editable due to Wix paywalls. 
New implemented solution uses Wix's in-built database creation and management tools instead of code or the Wix module to 
make and show the database, but leaves the Wix profile and login Module in place to potentially improve upon in the future
pending use of paid features. Proof of completion is two screenshots showing the back-end database and the front-end
page visible to users.
